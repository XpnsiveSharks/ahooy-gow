# Character Slots

This is a small browser slot game. It shows three reels on a canvas and lets you spin them with the SPIN button.

How it works
- Click SPIN to start the animation.
- The reels change quickly for a few seconds, then stop on a final result.
- If all three match, you get a BIG WIN and a jackpot banner with confetti.
- If two match, you get a SMALL WIN and a small win banner.
- If nothing matches, you see TRY AGAIN.

Sound and settings
- Background music plays after you start spinning (if it is turned on).
- Sound effects play for spins, wins, and losses.
- The settings button opens a small panel with audio controls.
- The volume slider changes both background music and sound effects.
- Setting the volume to zero turns both background music and sound effects off.
- Clicking outside the settings panel closes it.

Files and structure
- HTML is in `index.html`.
- Styles are in `style.css`.
- Game code is split into modules inside `src/`.
